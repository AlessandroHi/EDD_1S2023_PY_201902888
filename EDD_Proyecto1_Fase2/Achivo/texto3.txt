Move that body, be like them
Make it look right down, 'cause we're in a crowd
We alive
Hands up
Alright
Yeah, put your jackets up
Get down
Tonight, we rise to the club ended
Whatever I choose to lose, I got nothing to lose
Freedom got me different now
The path is clear
I got nothin' to lose, nothin' to lose-
Ready, let's go
Bless you, girl
Give me that
You're on the winning side
Play some house, DJ, oh
Bless you, girl
Give me that
I'm back again spittin' on the track again
Gotta get you
Dancin'
